Delicious Meal:
- API calls: bookmark each of the pages del.icio.us/url/<hash value>, see how many people have bookmarked
- taking initial hash value: bookmark it:
- take the response, parse for:
	- bookmarking users
	- hash value: bookmark new page, continue ad inifinitum

- try retrieving apple.com or grc.com
	- see http://transmission.m0k.org/trac/browser/trunk/macosx/PortChecker.h?rev=956 for example code

- all the changes we made to bookmarkURL, need to be made to getDeliciousblah
- once we have the results saved in the NSMutableArray, we need to update the TableView
- tabulate results (hash URL and counts) into NSTableView
future improvements:
	- don't busy wait on the bool! do a synchronous call instead
	- remove name and password: pull from keychain
- later modifications:
	- 2-4 seconds (random interval) between each page request
		- some sort of feedback for this? notice text in the window?
			- "Waiting for APIâ€¦"
